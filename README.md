**If you want to build old version of CM6 check branch CM6_V1**<br />

**Main difference between V1 and V2 are in the drivers used. V1 used S-drive that was hard to source and had poor software support and were expensive while V2 uses [Spectral drives](https://github.com/PCrnjak/Spectral-Micro-BLDC-controller) that are much cheeper and have good software support and connectivity.**


CM6 uses 6 gimbal BLDC motors paired with small gear ratio gearboxes ( from 5:1 to 9:1), by doing that it is passively compliant and safe. Each Joint uses an [Spectral driver](https://github.com/PCrnjak/Spectral-Micro-BLDC-controller) that is mounted on modular actuator designs for specific gimbal motors. Design can be changed easily by using different-sized aluminum extrusions or changing the gear ratio of modular gearboxes. The robots main goal is to be research platform for developement of compliant and safe robotics. 

***Note* that this robot is not as refined as our other robots like PAROL6; some parts are hard to source and might be much more expensive. Building instructions are also not as good and you will need to tinker a lot!**
